## Introduction:
This is a fake modern website of some sexual advice and service called TAE, The alluring Experience.



## About
This is an assignment of Codecamy. It was a boring one, suggesting making a company website. So I came up with a weird idea just to make a weird company. Here it is, The Alluring Experience.

## Problems I faced and questions I have
1. Flex box stuff
    I am still not very familiar with the concept. I only use basic function and can't really understand the difference between `inline-flex`, `inline-block`,`block` and `flex.`
2. Title
    It doesn't really go as I wanted it to be. 
    I want a long bar behind the `h1`. I want to place the `h1` on the left of the picture, fixed when the bar will go the full width no matter how the window size is. 
3. Font size
    There's no max and min default for font size.
    `min()` and `max()` in css is so hard to understand.
4. The container
    I figured out the container can shrink smaller than the text. It can be kinda stylish. But what if I want it to allign the bottom not top?

5. The Nav bar
    How can it follow the whole length of the picture above, or just the width of the page? How can I adjust so that it can spread out evenly with the width that I want?
6. Pictures
    How can I cut off the part of the pictures that I don't want?
7. Still the Nav bar
    So I made a responsive one with midea query. There is a gap between the left of the button. If I set the with of the button to `100%`, the right side will exceed the window. What happened?

8. Container again 
    Can I shrink the nav bar container so that my buttons could be just right below the picture?

These are the problems so far....
